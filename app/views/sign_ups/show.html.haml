  This is your secret sign up page. Only you (and the GDI Organizers) have access to this URL (unless you share it with someone else, but that's kind of silly and defeats the purpose of having a secret sign up page, now doesn't it?).

%p
  You can sign up to TA new classes below, or change your RSVP for classes you already signed up to TA.

%p
  %b To use your credit hours:
  Email <a href="mailto:liza@girldevelopit.com">Liz</a> and she will get you signed up in Meetup. That's unfortunately still a manual process.
