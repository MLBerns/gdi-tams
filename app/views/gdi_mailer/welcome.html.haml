  if you want to TA for every session, you have to sign up for each one. This is great for you because you can attend as many (or as few) sessions in a series as you want! Multi-day classes will be indicated with a 'Series' badge.
%h2 Emails

%h2 Credit hours
%p
  When you TA for Girl Develop It Chicago, you will accumulate credit hours that can be used toward upcoming classes. Each class or session will list the number of credit hours you can earn for TA'ing. Usually, credit hours are earned as a 2:1 ratio, but some classes are worth more or less, depending on the nature of the material.
%p
  We don't expect everyone to take us up on this offer, but some of our TAs have expressed interest in taking classes, and we wanted to make it possible to us to reward you for oyur hard work.
%p
  %b The terms for using credit hours are as follows:
%ul
  %li Credit hours can only be used to cover the full cost of the class (no discounts or partial payment)
  %li One credit hour == one hour of instruction time (or about $10)
  %li You can only use credit hours you've earned: pending credit hours aren't available to spend, and you can't go into credit hour debt
  %li We carefully manage class capacity, and sometimes we might not have a spot for you (but we'll try our best to fit you in)
%p
  To use credit hours, contact Liz directly.
